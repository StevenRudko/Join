                    <h2>Applicable Legal Bases</h2>
                    <p>
                        Below, you will find an overview of the legal bases of the GDPR on which we process personal
                        data. Please note that, in addition to the provisions of the
                        GDPR, national data protection regulations in your or our country of residence or establishment
                        may apply. Furthermore, if specific legal bases are
                        applicable in individual cases, we will inform you of these in the privacy policy.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Consent (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR)</h4>
                    <p>
                        The data subject has given consent to the processing of their personal data for one or more
                        specific purposes.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Legitimate Interests (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR)</h4>
                    <p>
                        Processing is necessary to protect the legitimate interests of the controller or a third party,
                        except where such interests are overridden by the interests
                        or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject requiring the protection of personal
                        data.
                    </p>

                    <h4>National Data Protection Regulations in Germany:</h4>
                    <p>
                        In addition to the data protection regulations of the GDPR, there are national data protection
                        regulations in Germany. This includes, in particular, the Law
                        for the Protection against Misuse of Personal Data in Data Processing (Bundesdatenschutzgesetz -
                        BDSG). The BDSG contains specific provisions regarding the
                        right to information, the right to deletion, the right to object, the processing of special
                        categories of personal data, processing for other purposes, and
                        transmission, as well as automated decision-making on an individual basis, including profiling.
                        Furthermore, state data protection laws of individual
                        federal states may also apply.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Reference to the Applicability of GDPR and Swiss Data Protection Act:</h4>
                    <p>
                        These data protection notices serve both to provide information in accordance with the Swiss
                        Federal Act on Data Protection (Schweizer DSG) and the General
                        Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). For this reason, please note that, for the sake of broader
                        spatial applicability and understanding, the terms of the GDPR
                        are used. In particular, the terms "processing" of "personal data," "legitimate interest," and
                        "special categories of data" as used in the GDPR are used
                        instead of the terms used in the Swiss DSG. However, the legal meaning of these terms is
                        determined within the scope of the Swiss DSG's applicability in
                        accordance with the Swiss DSG.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Security Measures</h2>
                    <p>
                        According to legal requirements and considering the state of the art, implementation costs, the
                        nature, scope, context, and purposes of processing, as well
                        as the varying likelihood and severity of risks to the rights and freedoms of natural persons,
                        we implement suitable technical and organizational measures
                        to ensure a level of protection appropriate to the risk.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These measures include, in particular, securing the confidentiality, integrity, and availability
                        of data by controlling physical and electronic access to
                        the data, as well as related access, input, disclosure, availability, and separation.
                        Additionally, we have established procedures to ensure the exercise of
                        data subject rights, data deletion, and responses to data breaches. Furthermore, we consider
                        data protection during the development or selection of
                        hardware, software, and processes, following the principles of data protection by design and by
                        default.
                    </p>

                        you have the right to object at any time to the processing of personal data concerning you for

                    </p>
